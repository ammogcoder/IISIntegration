# ASP.NET Core Module

The ASP.NET Core Module is an IIS Module which is responsible for process
management of ASP.NET Core http listeners and to proxy requests to the process
that it manages.

## Installing the latest ASP.NET Core Module
The ASP.NET Core Module for IIS can be installed on servers without installing the .NET Core runtime. You can download the [Windows (Server Hosting) installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=832756) and run the following command from an Administrator command prompt:
``DotNetCore.1.1.0.Preview1-WindowsHosting.exe OPT_INSTALL_LTS_REDIST=0 OPT_INSTALL_FTS_REDIST=0``

## Pre-requisites for building

### Windows 8.1+ or Windows Server 2012 R2+

### Visual C++ Build Tools

[Download](http://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/3/D23F4D0F-BA2D-4600-8725-6CCECEA05196/vs_community_ENU.exe)
and install Visual Studio 2015. In Visual Studio 2015 C++ tooling is no longer
installed by default, you must chose "Custom" install and select Visual C++.

Optionally, if you don't want to install Visual Studio you can just install the
[Visual C++ build tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).

### MSBuild

If you have installed Visual Studio, you should already have MSBuild. If you
installed the Visual C++ build tools, you will need to download and install
[Microsoft Build Tools 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159)

Once you have installed MSBuild, you can add it your path. The default location
for MSBuild is `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MSBuild\14.0\Bin`

### Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 8.1

[Download](http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/0/C/B0C80BA3-8AD6-4958-810B-6882485230B5/standalonesdk/sdksetup.exe)
and install the Windows SDK for Windows 8.1. From the Feature list presented,
ensure you select *Windows Software Development Kit*.

If chose to install from the command prompt, you can run the following command.
````
.\sdksetup.exe /features OptionId.WindowsDesktopSoftwareDevelopmentKit
````
